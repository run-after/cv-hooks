CV App with Hooks

This project is part of The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/cv-application)

I created a simple CV App with React that allows you to make an online resume. You can edit sections, delete jobs/schools, and add jobs/schools.

This App was styled with Bootstrap.
